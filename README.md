# michal-ilyayev.github.io

This is [my personal website](https://michal-ilyayev.github.io). 

It's built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), 
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [React](https://react.dev/); 
and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

This site is still a **work in progress**. I am building it as I learn new technologies and improve my skills.

The site is designed to be a portfolio of my work and a place to share my thoughts and ideas.
