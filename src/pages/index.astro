            <p>
              Hello! I'm Michal Ilyayev, a student at Westmount Collegiate Institute in Ontario,
              pursuing a career in Software Engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have a passion for creativity and technology, and my interests span across art, swimming, piano,
              and badminton.
            </p>
            <p>
              My journey into Computer Science began at a young age when my dad first introduced me to the world of
              technology.
              From that moment, I was hooked - fascinated by the endless possibilities of creating and innovating
              through
              code.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm eager to learn, and always seeking ways to improve, and help others.
            </p>
            <p>
              This website showcases my achievements and highlights some of the projects that have defined who I am as
              both a creator and a problem solver.

              Art has always been close to my heart, a passion that began when my grandfather first introduced me to
              it.
            </p>
            <p>
              That early curiosity sparked a creative journey, eventually leading to my acceptance into the
              prestigious Westmount Arts Program.
              Over the past three and a half years, I've gained valuable insights and refined my skills, deepening my
              creativity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Below are some of my favorite artworks that I've developed during this time, each representing a unique
              aspect of my artistic growth.
            </p>
            <p>
              I hope you enjoy them as much as I enjoyed creating them!

            <p>
              "Shield Initiative" is a special project that is very meaningful to me.
              It was originally founded by Ilan Danjoux to create custom-designed shields for hospital IV poles to
              bring comfort to children in healthcare environments.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over time, the club gained popularity, formed partnerships with organizations like VIBE Dance Studio,
              and hosted events both in and out of school.
              It even <a target="_blank"
              href="https://globalnews.ca/news/5427319/shield-initiative-brings-fun-sick-kids/">received attention from
              global news outlets</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, the initiative faced setbacks during the COVID-19 pandemic, and leadership changes caused
              the club to lose momentum. When I learned about this, I felt strongly connected to the mission and decided
              to step up as a leader.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the previous leaders unexpectedly stepped down, I found myself rebuilding the club from scratch,
              with only half a year left and a small but passionate team of 12 students.
              Despite the challenges, we successfully produced 10 shields and established meaningful connections,
              including with Chai Lifeline, who were thrilled to receive our work.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, my focus is on expanding the Shield Initiative, bringing in new members, and ensuring that future
              generations can continue this meaningful work.
            </p>
            <p>
              My goal is to restore the club to its full potential and leave behind a lasting legacy.
              Our team is growing, we gained valuable positive feedback from our partners, and we are excited to see
              where this journey takes us.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the support of my team, I am confident that we can achieve this goal.
            </p>
