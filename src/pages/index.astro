              Hello! I'm Michal Ilyayev, a student at Westmount Collegiate Institute in Ontario,
              pursuing a career in Software Engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have a passion for creativity and technology, and my interests span across art, swimming, piano,
              and so much more...

              My journey into Computer Science began at a young age when my dad first introduced me to the world of
              technology.
              From that moment, I was hooked - fascinated by the endless possibilities of creating and innovating
              through
              code.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm eager to learn, and always seeking ways to improve, and help others.
            </p>
            <p>
              This website showcases my achievements and highlights some of the projects that have defined who I am as
              both a creator and a problem solver.

              Art has always been close to my heart, a passion that began when my grandfather first introduced me to
              it.
            </p>
            <p>
              That early curiosity sparked a creative journey, eventually leading to my acceptance into the
              prestigious Westmount CI Arts Program.
              Over the past three and a half years, I've gained valuable insights and refined my skills, deepening my
              creativity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Below are some of my favorite artworks that I've developed during this time, each representing a unique
              aspect of my artistic growth.
            </p>
            <p>
              I hope you enjoy them as much as I enjoyed creating them!

              The Shield Initiative
            </a>
          </h2>
          <div class="prose">

            <p>
              "The Shield Initiative" is a special project that is very meaningful to me.
              It was originally founded by Ilan Danjoux to create custom-designed shields for hospital IV poles to
              bring comfort to children in healthcare environments.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over time, the club gained popularity, formed partnerships with organizations like VIBE Dance Studio,
              and hosted events both in and out of school.
              It even received attention from global news outlets.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, the initiative faced setbacks during the COVID-19 pandemic, and leadership changes caused
              the club to lose momentum. When I learned about this, I felt strongly connected to the mission and decided
              to step up as a leader.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the previous leaders unexpectedly stepped down, I found myself rebuilding the club from scratch,
              with only half a year left and a small but passionate team of 12 students.
              Despite the challenges, we successfully produced 10 shields and established meaningful connections,
              including with Chai Lifeline, who were thrilled to receive our work.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, my focus is on expanding the Shield Initiative, bringing in new members, and ensuring that future
              generations can continue this meaningful work.
            </p>
            <p>
              My goal is to restore the club to its full potential and leave behind a lasting legacy.
              Our team is growing, we gained valuable positive feedback from our partners, and we are excited to see
              where this journey takes us.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the support of my team, I am confident that we can achieve this goal.
            </p>
